# ProjectThree

Concept - Problem and solution

Initially when you learn the boot strap it was like going from square to a cube in terms of styling

but as you go further in the project you start using different css framework  to improve the styling and make it more unique but even than you still tend to customise the look and feel. 

so the concept is having UI interface for creating your own/organizations custom css framework. 

Benefits 
- Keeps the code clean without having big css files 
- easier to handle with interns and someone who might not be into UI/UX
- easier to maintain consistent style changes in a large team bases
- users dont need to dig around to get the css styling you have implemented 
- can work at the similar time 

- You be able to create a project
- Create Team/profile
- Set Super admin permission (who can see the custom css for projects, who can assign/remove team menembers, create team)
- dashboard for different members, admin sees all teams, team can only see the groups they are in
- default cdn link 
- Ui interface to change your framework 
- preview of the control 
- Review notification to accept changes 
- Font selector 
- Favicon 

Presentation idea
- show naked html page with link included in the html
- once you have made changes in the Ui, refresh the page to show the difference


Flow
- add link to html
- Super Admin create a group on "" adds project lead - sends email
- Project lead creates teams, and adds users
- users and project lead customises the CSS framework - Maybe get project lead to approve?
