## Overview

```
In this activity, you'll create a new React-based Google Books Search app. This assignment requires you to create React components, work with helper/util functions, and utilize React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. You'll also use Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

This application requires at minimum 2 pages:

- Search - User can search for books via the Google Books API and render them here. User has the option to "View" a book, bringing them to the book on Google Books, or "Save" a book, saving it to the Mongo database.

- Saved - Renders all books saved to the Mongo database. User has an option to "View" the book, bringing them to the book on Google Books, or "Delete" a book, removing it from the Mongo database.

At a minimum, books should have each of the following fields:

- title - Title of the book from the Google Books API
- authors - The books's author(s) as returned from the Google Books API
